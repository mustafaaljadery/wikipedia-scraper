Small task forces need to make a particular effort to centralize their discussions on the task force's pages.  When no one posts to the task force's talk page, some editors will assume that no one is doing anything.  This makes it hard for new editors to participate in your group.

The advice given by Kirill Lokshin of  WikiProject Military history is that task forces are something to get serious about when there are 50-100 participants in your WikiProject.  Additionally, a good number to start a task force with is five people; it may not be effective until it reaches 10 or so people, but having the task force there enables them to recruit.  An additional thought is that creating task forces encourages people to participate in those rather than creating their own WikiProject which again incurs a lot of bureaucratic overhead.  \n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"WikiProject Military history"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"Since this section is quite incomplete, it may be useful to read Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Military history/Coordinators#How to...
