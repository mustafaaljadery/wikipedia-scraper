While some editors felt that the whole process was unsalvageable, others expressed interest in a dedicated project to target the backlog. Requested articles is one of Wikipedia's oldest processes (dating back to 2001) and offers individuals the ability to suggest articles that should be created but which they do not wish to write themselves. Suggestions cover a huge diversity of topics and are split into a series of lists on multiple pages.\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"a Requests for Comment"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"The project is currently in the initial planning stages, but which will ultimately conclude in a revision to the Requested Articles process, including providing sources.\n"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"As of 2019, the WikiProject was inactive as it never properly got off of its feet.
