Instead of following every rule, it is acceptable to use common sense as you go about editing. Being too wrapped up in rules can cause a loss of perspective, so there are times when it is better to ignore a rule. Even if a contribution \"violates\" the precise wording of a rule, it might still be a good contribution. Similarly, just because something is not forbidden in a written document, or is even explicitly permitted, doesn't mean it's a good idea in the given situation. Our goal is to improve Wikipedia so that it better informs readers.  Being able to articulate \"common sense\" reasons why a change helps the encyclopedia is good, and editors should not ignore those reasons because they don't reference a bunch of shortcut links to official policies.  The principle of the rules—to make Wikipedia and its sister projects thrive—is more important than the letter.  Editors must use their best judgment.\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"common sense"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"shortcut links"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"Editors must use their best judgment"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"Why isn't \"use common sense\" an official policy?

Other editors are likely to ascribe very different meanings and values to words and concepts than you, so try to state your arguments as fully as possible.
