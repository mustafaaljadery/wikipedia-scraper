They may see this as a confirmation of their misplaced suspicions. Especially among their fellow editors and peers, is there really no cabal? A cabal works in secret and avoids claiming responsibility. Wikipedia's editors, as unlikeable and unfair as the ideas and actions of some may seem, cannot be justifiably accused of those attributes. They can call those groups that are a little too human and prominent for their taste a faction if they were into cohesion, or could consider the possibility that you're only political, and have a tendency to confront when their hostility towards all of you lumps you all together.\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"cabal"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"too human"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"faction"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"It's much more productive to refute the arguments of the majority through reasoned discussion than imply they are wrong because they are the majority, or implying you are being repressed because they don't agree with you.
