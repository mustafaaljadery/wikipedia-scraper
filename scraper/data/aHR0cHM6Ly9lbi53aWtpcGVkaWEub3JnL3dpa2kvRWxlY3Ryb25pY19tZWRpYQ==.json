Samuel Morse invented the telegraph in 1832, introducing wires to transmit electrical signals over long distances. In 1844, the first successful telegraph line was established in the United States, and in the 1850s, telegraph cables were laid across the Atlantic connecting North America and Europe.[2] At the same time the telegraph was becoming mainstream, the need to transmit images over wire emerged. The first commercially successful fax machine was developed by Elisha Gray in 1861, allowing printed images to be transmitted over a wire.[3]\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"Wire"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"transmission lines"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"telegraph"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[2]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[3]"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"The telephone was another breakthrough in electronic communication, allowing people to communicate using voice rather than written messages. Alexander Graham Bell pioneered the first successful telephone transmission in 1876, and by the 1890s, telephone lines were being laid worldwide.[4] Since all these significant breakthroughs relied on transmission lines for communication, a minor improvement was made by the English engineer Oliver Heaviside who patented the coaxial cable in 1880.[5] The coaxial cable allowed for greater bandwidth and longer transmission distances.\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"telephone"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[4]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"coaxial cable"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[5]"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"Significant improvements in the mode of transmission were made in the last seventy years with the introduction of fiber optics, wireless transmission, satellite transmission, Free Space Optics, and the internet. Fiber optics was first developed in the 1950s but became commercially viable in the 1970s. On the other hand, wireless communication made a major improvement in the transmission mode, doing away with wires and introducing electromagnetic waves. Guglielmo Marconi invented the radio transmission in 1897, and by the 1900s, radio transmission had become a mainstream source of news, entertainment, and military communication.[6] Satellite communication allowed data to be transmitted over much longer distances than possible. The United States pioneered satellite communication in 1958 when it first launched Explorer 1.[7]\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"fiber optics"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[6]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[7]"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"Free Space Optics (FSO), which uses lasers to transmit data through the air, was first developed in the 1960s. However, it was only in the 1990s that the technology advanced enough to become commercially viable.[8] The internet, on the other hand, emerged in the second half of the last century. In the 1960s, the first protocols for transferring files were developed, making it possible to transfer files between computers. In 1989, Tim Berners Lee created the World Wide Web, making it much easier to share information through hyperlinks. In 1996, the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) was introduced, allowing for live audio and video streaming over the internet. RTP was a breakthrough in online entertainment, allowing real-time events to be broadcast live to audiences worldwide.\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[8]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"RTP"},{"TagName":"h3","Data":"Display and output[edit]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"edit"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"The history of display and output technology is long and fascinating, beginning in the early 19th century with the development of the galvanometer, which was used to detect and measure small electrical currents. In 1844, the telegraph sounder was developed, which used an electromagnet to produce a clicking sound that corresponded to the transmission of electrical signals over a telegraph line.[9] It was followed by the telephone receiver, which used a diaphragm to convert electrical signals into sound. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the first forms of artificial light were developed, including red light and neon.

The CRT was used for early television and computer displays.[10] The radio and television tuner was also developed in the early 20th century, allowing people to receive and tune in to broadcast signals.

The first computer monitor was developed in the 1950s, and the first commercial PC monitor was introduced in 1976. Large electronic displays were introduced in 1985, allowing for the production of large-scale displays for use in stadiums, arenas, and other public spaces. HDTV was first proposed as a term in 1936, but it was in the 1990s that standards were established for producing and broadcasting high-definition television signals.[10] The head-mounted display (HMD) was introduced in 1968 and continues to be developed and improved to this day, allowing for immersive virtual reality experiences and other applications.\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[11]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[10]"},{"TagName":"h3","Data":"Electric signal processing[edit]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"edit"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"The history of electrical signal processing is closely tied to the development of electronic communications technology, beginning in the mid-18th century with the invention of the capacitor, which allowed for the capture and storage of electrical charges.

Online routing, or the ability to direct electronic signals to specific destinations, was first developed in 1969 with the creation of the ARPANET, a precursor to the modern internet.[14] Electronic programming, or the ability to use electronic signals to control and automate processes, has been developed since the 1940s and continues to be an important area of research and development in electrical signal processing.\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[12]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[13]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"[14]"},{"TagName":"h3","Data":"Electronic information storage[edit]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"edit"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"The history of electronic information storage dates back to the 18th century, with the invention of punched cards and paper tape in 1725 and 1846, respectively.
