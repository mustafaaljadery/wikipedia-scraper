In addition, the humour therapy was more effective in reducing negative affect as the degree of affect increased in intensity.[43]: 575–576  Humour was immediately effective in helping to deal with distress. The escapist nature of humour as a coping mechanism suggests that it is most useful in dealing with momentary stresses.

A distancing of thought leads to a distancing of the unilateral responses people often have to negative arousal.

With this transition certain social interactions with friend and family may be limited forcing the individual to look elsewhere for these social interactions. Humour has been shown to make transitions easier, as humour is shown reduce stress and facilitate socialisation and serves as a social bonding function.[51] Humour may also help the transition in helping the individual to maintain positive feelings towards those who are enforcing the changes in their lives.
