As noted in that policy, \"Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia and, as a means to that end, an online community of individuals interested in building a high-quality encyclopedia in a spirit of mutual respect. Therefore, there are certain things that Wikipedia is not.\" For example, Wikipedia content is not a paper encyclopedia, a dictionary, a blog or webspace provider, or a crystal ball and the Wikipedia community is not a democracy, bureaucracy, battleground, or an anarchy. Importantly, Wikipedia is not censored. However, since What Wikipedia is not was first developed beginning at least as early as September 24, 2001, a number of proposed additions never made it in. This essay looks at portions of the policy that were removed in the editing process and not included in the work's final, publicly released version. In addition, it looks at portions of the policy that may have been removed had they been added in the editing process, but nonetheless have relevance to the policy. In effect, What Wikipedia is not – Outtakes may provide a perspective to the What Wikipedia is not official policy to provide the reader a better understanding of what Wikipedia is not.\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"What Wikipedia is not"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"encyclopedia"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"online community"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"September 24, 2001"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"the"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"the"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"Note: Some really bad jokes are now at Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not/BJAODN.\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not/BJAODN"},{"TagName":"h2","Data":"W1K1P3D14 15 N07 4 P14C3 F0R 13375P34K[edit]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"edit"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"1f y0u  13375p33k h3r3, y0u wi11 g37 b10cked.\n"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"13375p33k"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"b10cked"},{"TagName":"h2","Data":"Wikipedia is not a place for REDACTED[edit]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"edit"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"We're sorry, this joke has been REDACTED due to it being unfunny.

However, this allegory's connection to the early days of Communist Russia is all too true. The leading pigs of the Farm take control, not only of the establishment, but also of the residents. They are able to mislead the all-too-ignorant populace into thinking whatever they do is a good thing for all. The crookedness of Animal Farm's government is shown from the very start, and comes through to the end, culminating in a slogan that was all too true when the real-life correlation to this story happened not so long ago.\nThe first flavor I would like to see is sweet onion. I like raw onions and I know that other people do too. In addition, the onion jelly bean would mix well with some of your existing jelly bean flavors. Another flavor that I thought would be exciting and popular is the egg flavored jelly bean. Many people I know eat eggs at all times of the day and so I think it would be a popular choice. Last, but not least, is the broccoli jelly bean. I understand that broccoli jelly beans might not sound very popular at first, but you could make them be a healthy snack to eat. If they were healthy, parents could get their kids to eat broccoli in a rather sweet way.\nIn the dining room, many pesky monsters roam, namely Werewolves and Headless Specters. However, they are no match for the mighty football helmet! Some of the collapsing floor tiles have snack boxes hidden directly under them. Jump quickly and take the risk of falling to grab these delicious packets of tastiness. Sometimes, the menacing lit fireplace may breathe fire, guarding a snack box. Time your jump carefully and snag it without being roasted. If you head-smash some webs against the wall, it will take you into a closet with some snacks and sandwiches in it. Although you might always have a full five dog-tags in health, it is a helpful oasis. (It's also fun to stand in the right place and get the view from the inside of a rotating sandwich!)\n"},{"TagName":"h2","Data":"Wikipedia is not a place to find The Truth[edit]"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"The Truth"},{"TagName":"a","Data":"edit"},{"TagName":"p","Data":"The Truth is out there ... wait, sorry, I mean out there.
