I created an account the other week but lost my password and failed to attach my account to an email address. My old account was TaxGalPDX. The account I created to post this message is TaxGalPDX2. Is there a way to merge the two accounts or do I just abandon TaxGalPDX and use this one from now on?

I just realized you don't have to type your name out each time.) I notice that some sources in articles will quote a portion of the text from the reference if you hove over it.
